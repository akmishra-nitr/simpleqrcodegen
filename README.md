## A simple QR Code Generator

This project showcases a simple QR code generator that can be used with an Android phone to read a custom QR code and generate the information stored in it. 

This project is meant for information purpose only. 

### QR Codes

QR codes, or Quick Response Codes, were first introduced in Japan in response to the need to encode a larger amount of information than what could be encoded using barcodes. A simple barcode can contain upto about 20 alphanumeric characters and the users wanted to code Kanji and Kana characters as well. For this, they approached DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED who then started development of a two-dimensional code. 

For more information on QR codes and their history, please check out the [QRcode Website](https://www.qrcode.com/en/history/).
